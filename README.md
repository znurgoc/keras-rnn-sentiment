# keras-rnn-sentiment
Simple sentiment analysis project using Keras and RNN

This project is a simple sentiment classification model built using Keras and a SimpleRNN layer. It uses the IMDB dataset to classify movie reviews as either positive (`1`) or negative (`0`).

##  Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- SimpleRNN
- IMDB dataset (from Keras datasets)

##  Project Description
The goal of this project is to build a basic understanding of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for natural language processing tasks.  
It was developed as part of a learning process while studying deep learning with Keras.
